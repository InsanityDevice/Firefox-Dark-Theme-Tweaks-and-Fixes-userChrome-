Interface tweaks for Firefox Quantum

1. Create a *chrome* folder in *%appdata%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\YOUR_PROFILE* and paste userChrome.css into it.
2. If you want to use more than one tweak, just open userChrome.css in Notepad or any code editor and paste the code you want into it.
3. Change whatever values you want.
4. Restart Firefox and voil√†!

*Everything works perfectly as of Firefox 68 beta 2.*
