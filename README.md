Interface tweaks for Firefox Quantum

1. Type about:config in your url bar and go to *toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets* to set it to *true*.
2. Create a *chrome* folder in *%appdata%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\YOUR_PROFILE* and paste userChrome.css into it.
3. If you want to use more than one tweak, just open userChrome.css in Notepad or any code editor and paste the code you want into it.
4. Change whatever values you want.
5. Restart Firefox and voil√†!

*Everything works perfectly as of Firefox 73.*
