I tweaked it a lot to be more aligned with the rest of the UI, while still looking very compact and similar to the traditional context menu. The 6px vertical margins for the inside of menus and around the separators of the PanelUI were reduced to 4 so that everything would be the same - 6 was too much in my opinion for context menus.

If anyone else than me ever uses it and notices an issue somewhere, please notify me. However, if it's about something you just don't like, I would appreciate if you could also provide a detailed solution of how I could improve it. I'm doing this for myself and putting it out there for the taking. I'm not selling anything and there will be no customer support or such.
