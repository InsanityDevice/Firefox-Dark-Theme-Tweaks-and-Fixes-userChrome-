Currently matched to the dark theme for my personal use.

For the light theme, just remove the comment brackets (<code>/**/</code>) from the corresponding line and add them to the one that is not in use.

Personas (custom themes) with dark text should be matched with the dark version (usually) while personas with light text should be matched with the light version (usually).
